# Gcipher ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gforcedev/Gcipher.svg?token=w2Ko67N59sgzxrJMpsG6&branch=master)

An automated cipher cracking program.

## How we work:
  Changes are made to the dev branch. We do this, and then when the feature (cipher) is added and the TRAVIS BUILD is true then we merge   with master and start again

## Ciphers:
  Caesar
  Mono-alphabetic Sub
  Rail-Fence
  Vigenere
  Column Transposition (not yet)
